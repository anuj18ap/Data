It was nice to hear from you.
Of course I will help you with your school project
You wanted to kn@ow about a typical morning
Well, on days whe*n I go to college I usually get up about 7.00 o'clock
My mum always ask/s me to sit down and have breakfast before I leave
Unfortunately, I d+on't have much time and I eat breakfast at college
I go to college by b-us.
